A gold main color, with warm undertones gave us the neutrality we were after, while still offering a modern, powerful and exciting feeling to the driver." />

We also gained a better understanding of the challenges that both Web Developers and CG-Designers face during projects, and how to make their tasks easier to handle.
        
        As Designers, we also got a better look at what exactly goes into designing a products, and all the different steps required to go from feeling to final delivery. This allowed us to better prioritize the important aspects of a project, while leaving less important parts for another day.
        
        Overall, we were reasonably happy with the work we managed to deliver with our CG-Designers. When it comes to the website, there were a few cases of mismanagement, which did leave a few things to be desired in the final product. We definitely learned a thing or two from these missteps, and we've made sure to better prepare for those challenges in the future." />
