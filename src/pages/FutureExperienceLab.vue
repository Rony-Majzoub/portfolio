A variety of images, illustrations and stylistic choices were used to create a chaotic feel, while also utilizing pre-defined grids and whitespace, to subconsciously organize that chaos." />

        description="After being presented with the project brief, we tried to narrow down what exactly the goal of the website was. We also wanted to narrow down what the exact target group of this website was, and what they valued. We presented these questions to the client, and tried to shape the project around those key points.
        Early on, we created a Moodboard for visualizing how a chaotic, yet readable website might look like. We narrowed it down towards a dark color scheme, with strong and contrasting colors used wisely to grab attention. We also found that simple, primitive shapes could be used to add some dynamic flare into the website, which is something we added to the moodboard." />

        title="Our stylesheet"
        description="The final stylesheet has a focus on three key areas - fonts, colors and patterns. 
        When it comes to fonts, we decided on a heavy, punk-like font for all titles and headers, to contribute towards a more heavy feel. We also used a lighter font for all body text, that was more readable, which made the site feel more professional and controlled.
        
        For our brand colors, we chose three strong colors, with two additional text & background colors. Throughout the website, we also use a variety of primitive shapes as decorative backgrounds. These are used in conjunction with our brand colors, to give off a feeling of chaos, as well as spice up the background as a whole.

      <ColumnRight
        title="Designing for the Web"
        description="For this project, we teamed up with the Web Developer class at Yrgo, who were responsible for coding and implementing our designs to the web. That's why we had to carefully adapt our working schedule to accomodate agile development with our Web Developers.

        Our first method was to deliver sections one-by-one in a timely manner, with greyboxes and large visual elements coming first. We'd also communicate if any changes to previous deliveries had been made.
        Our second method was to utilize Components and Color/Text Styles extensively in Figma, to better allow for reusable code in the final website. This drastically cut down the time needed to code the website, while also giving a more consistent design to the entire prototype." />

        title="Final prototypes"
        description="The final prototypes were made in Figma, with fine-tuned desktop and mobile variants. The prototypes were also made with a responsive layout in mind, both for larger and smaller screens. We provided multiple pages, assets and illustrations that were used in the final website. " />
      <ColumnLeft
        title="Learnings"
        description="We gained more experience on how to work under a tight deadline, and what to prioritize in those cases. We also gained better understanding for how Web Developers work, and their requirements.
        For future projects, we'd focus on getting more prep-time as designers, so we could deliver assets to our Web Developers immediately, instead of them having to wait without any tasks at hand. We'd also like to perform more extensive user testing, to further refine our design and layout, but the time constraints did not allow this.
        Overall, we were very satisfied with the project, and felt that there was a lot of potential if we were to continue with the project." />
